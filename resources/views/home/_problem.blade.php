        <p class="subheader">
            Shopify is a fantastic tool for your customers to run their webshop. But when it comes to building front ends for stores it’s lacking behind.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You have to maintain a connection between your local environment and Shopify.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You are locked in using tools like Themekit.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You are forced to use Liquid, Shopify’s own templating language.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    It’s not easy to implement a modern javascript framework such as Vue or React.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you have to compile ES6 you need to run a separate build tool.
